# Todo App

This project is a classic todo app built with React as a [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW). 
The app allows users to add, complete, delete and filter tasks. Users can also reorder todos with a drag and drop and switch between light and dark modes.
